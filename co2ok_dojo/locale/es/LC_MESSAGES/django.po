"For the Ninja App to work properly it needs to have access to the "

"our partners’ sites. In short, the Ninja App downloads the list of partner "
"shops, then works in the background, comparing the website you’re viewing "
"against the downloaded list, and if there is a match, it shows our  CO₂ok "
"button. The information about visited websites does not leave your computer, "
"so your privacy is protected. The Ninja App has an open code available at <a "

"First of all, our partners usually donate 2-12 times more through the Ninja "

"Smile is a way to achieve that. Moreover, there are a lot of products or "

msgid ""
"Yes, there are three reasons: 1) We are constantly working on new "
"partnerships, so we may partner with stores that you do use in the near "
"future. It’s easier to have it already installed rather than regularly check "
"if stores that you use have been added. 2) If you even once decide to buy "
"from our partners stores, having the Ninja App already installed can be a "
"difference with the output of CO₂ in the world. It’s better to have it "
"installed just in case, rather than miss an easy opportunity to do a lot of "
"good for free. 3) It is easier to establish new partnerships with a bigger "
"user base: the more users the Ninja App  has, the easier it is to convince "
"new stores to join our initiative. Therefore, by installing the  Ninja App, "
"you make it more probable that we will partner with shops you use in the "
"future."

"After installing the Ninja app you will see a our “Shop CO₂ok” box whilst "

"then on, whenever you buy something, CO₂ok receives a portion of the price "
"you pay (usually between 1%% and 6%%). We donate our profits to carefully "
