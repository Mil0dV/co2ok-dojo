It’s better to have it installed just in case, rather than miss an easy opportunity to do a lot of good for free. 3) It is easier to establish new partnerships with a bigger user base: the more users the Ninja App  has, the easier it is to convince new stores to join our initiative. Therefore, by installing the  Ninja App, you make it more probable that we will partner with shops you use in the future."
